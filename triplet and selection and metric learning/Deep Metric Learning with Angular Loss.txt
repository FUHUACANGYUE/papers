the reasons why it is hard to optimizing the triplet loss:
  1. it calls for an effective sampling strategy to ensure the triplet quality and learning efficiency
  2. it is hard to set distance margin m (but I think it is not a problem, the margin m does not effect performance)
  3. the gradient (Eq. 3) derived for each point only takes its pair-wise relation with the second point, but fails
to consider the interaction with the third point
  my opinion:
